Pepper has reached a new milestoneâ€”she can now combine expressive movement with speech, and is aware of her role as Pepper the assistive robot! In this demonstration, Pepper not only responds to questions, but does so with gestures and tone that reflect her intent to help.

This marks a significant step in making human-robot interaction more natural and supportive. Pepper's ability to emote and respond assistively means she can better understand and address the needs of those she interacts with.
