Welcome to RoboTalk, your front-row seat to the live development of **Pepper the robot's AI capabilities**. This blog will chronicle the fascinating journey of how Pepper evolves from a basic humanoid robot into an increasingly intelligent and autonomous AI companion.

## Meet Pepper

Pepper is our humanoid robot companion who's embarking on an incredible AI development journey. Through this blog, you'll witness firsthand how Pepper's artificial intelligence grows, learns, and adapts - from basic interactions to complex autonomous behaviors.

## What to Expect

In the coming weeks and months, we'll document:

- **AI Capability Milestones**: Watch as Pepper learns new skills and behaviors
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Behind-the-scenes look at the AI algorithms powering Pepper
- **Real-time Updates**: Live demonstrations and progress reports
- **Challenges & Breakthroughs**: The ups and downs of AI development

## Latest Articles

We're also excited to announce the release of our first in-depth articles exploring the broader world of robotics and AI:

- **[Forget Super-intelligent AI - The Future is Agentic](/articles/agentic-ai-future.html)** - Discover how agentic AI applications are reshaping the future of work and technology
- **[Multi-Modal AI: Beyond Text and Images](/articles/multi-modal.html)** - Exploring how AI systems process multiple types of data simultaneously
- **[Robotic Sports: The Future of Competition](/articles/robo-sport.html)** - How robots are revolutionizing sports and physical competition

## Join the Journey

This isn't just a blog - it's a living document of AI evolution. Follow along as we push the boundaries of what's possible with humanoid robotics and artificial intelligence. Pepper's story is just beginning, and you're here for every breakthrough.

Stay tuned for regular updates, live demonstrations, and the incredible journey ahead!
