    <h4>What the video shows:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Pepper hearing and processing human speech</li>
      <li>Real-time conversion of speech to text</li>
      <li>AI language model generating appropriate responses</li>
      <li>Text-to-speech synthesis producing natural voice output</li>
      <li>Complete end-to-end conversation flow</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Technical Achievement:</strong> This demonstration showcases the successful integration of three AI models working in harmony - speech recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis.</p>
    
    <p><em>Video will be embedded here once hosting is configured.</em></p>

This demo features an orchestration of a total of three AI Models:
- **Speech-to-Text Model**: Converts my speech to text
- **Language Model Connection**: Allows Pepper to think of a response
- **Text-to-Speech Model**: Decodes Pepper's thoughts to audible speech
