## New Article: The Brains Behind Modern Humanoids

I'm excited to announce the publication of my latest comprehensive article: **[Brains for Bots: How Multimodal AI is Supercharging the Next Generation of Humanoids](/articles/multi-modal.html)**.

### What This Article Explores

This deep dive examines how the fusion of large language models and robotics is creating humanoid robots that can perceive, reason, and act like never before. The article covers:

- **The Multimodal Revolution**: How robots combine vision, language, and motor control
- **The Engineering Stack**: From pixels to fingers - the technical architecture
- **Real-World Applications**: Figure AI, Tesla Optimus, and Unitree's breakthroughs
- **Ethical Implications**: The blurring boundaries between tools and companions

### Why This Matters

When Figure AI released footage of their humanoid robot recognizing objects and responding to spoken commands, it wasn't just impressive - it was a glimpse into the future of human-robot interaction. This article explains how multimodal AI makes this possible and what it means for the future.

The piece breaks down the complex engineering behind these systems while making the concepts accessible to non-experts.
