Today marks another exciting step in Pepper the robot's AI journeyâ€”Pepper has performed its first physical movement: a successful handshaking gesture! This milestone demonstrates the integration of AI-driven intent with real-world robotic motion, bringing Pepper closer to meaningful human-robot interaction.

Pepper's handshaking was achieved after several iterations of motion planning and sensor calibration. This is a huge leap from speech-only interaction, showing that Pepper can now combine perception, decision-making, and physical action.
