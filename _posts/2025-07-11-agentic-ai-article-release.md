## New Article Released: The Future is Agentic

I'm excited to announce the publication of my latest in-depth article: **[Forget Super-intelligent AI - The Future is Agentic](/articles/agentic-ai-future.html)**.

### What This Article Explores

In this comprehensive piece, I dive deep into why the AI industry is shifting away from the AGI hype and toward practical, agentic AI applications. The article covers:

- **The Reality Behind AGI Hype**: Why "artificial general intelligence" is more marketing than science
- **Agentic AI in Action**: How autonomous AI systems are already reshaping work and technology
- **The New Digital Workforce**: The explosion of specialized AI agents orchestrating entire workflows
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: How we can shape these emerging agents responsibly

### Why This Matters

While everyone's talking about AGI, the real revolution is happening in agentic AI - systems that can act autonomously, set goals, and make decisions. This isn't science fiction; it's happening right now in labs and companies around the world.

The article explains how agentic AI is fundamentally different from traditional chatbots and why this shift represents the next evolution of artificial intelligence.
