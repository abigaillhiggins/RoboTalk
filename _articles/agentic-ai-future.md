"AGI" — artificial general intelligence — is one of tech's most seductive buzzwords. In investor decks and glossy headlines, it's painted as a coming superintelligence that can do everything a human can, only better. But behind the hype, AGI is a loose and often ill-defined industry term. It acts more like a narrative magnet than a clear technical goal: it attracts attention, funding, and existential speculation.

But beyond the investor hype, what is really moving AI development forward in 2025?

## Agentic Applications

It's not the dream of a single, all-knowing supermind — it's the rise of agentic AI. These are systems designed to act autonomously, set goals, and make decisions on their own. Instead of passively waiting for commands like traditional AI models, agentic AI takes initiative: it can plan multi-step workflows, write and test its own code, or manage complex tasks with minimal human input.

So what exactly is an "agent"? In simple terms, an agent is an AI system that doesn't just respond — it acts. Unlike a traditional large-language-model chatbot, an agent maintains ongoing context, makes decisions toward specific goals, and can take multiple steps without constant supervision [[1]](#sources). An agent can analyze a problem, decide on the next best action, adapt to changing conditions, and even interact with other systems or agents to get things done. This shift from simple prediction to dynamic, autonomous decision-making is what makes agentic AI so powerful — and so fundamentally different from the reactive tools we're used to, like ChatGPT.

```

In practical terms, we're already seeing agentic applications everywhere: AI agents that schedule meetings, design marketing campaigns, automate lab research, or run financial strategies. They don't match human-level "general" intelligence, but they excel in focused domains with surprising independence.

## The New dot-com Boom

Agentic applications feel like the new dot-com boom — but instead of websites and e-commerce stores, we're witnessing an explosion of specialised digital "workers" orchestrating entire workflows. Just as the internet reshaped how businesses operated in the 2000s, agentic AI is redefining what work looks like in the mid-2020s and beyond.

Startups are racing to build agents that can handle everything from customer support to drug discovery, while large enterprises are reorganising around hybrid teams of human employees and autonomous AI counterparts. The energy and capital flooding into this space suggest we're only at the beginning of a massive shift — one that may ultimately change not just industries, but the very concept of productivity itself [[2]](#sources).

## How to Navigate a World of AI Agents

As agentic AI continues to evolve, the challenge isn't just technological — it's deeply human. We'll need new ways to manage trust, accountability, and collaboration with systems that can act on their own. Regulations, workplace structures, and even cultural norms will have to adapt to a world where digital agents share the stage with us as semi-autonomous partners.

Instead of fearing or blindly chasing a mythical AGI, we should focus on shaping these emerging agents responsibly: designing clear guardrails, aligning them with human values, and deciding where we want human judgment to remain irreplaceable [[3]](#sources). The future won't belong to a single superintelligence — it will belong to a diverse ecosystem of specialized, goal-driven agents working alongside us. How we choose to shape that world starts now.
